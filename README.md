I conducted a comprehensive HR analytics study on employee attrition, aiming to uncover key factors influencing employee turnover. The goal was to provide data-driven insights to help HR teams improve retention strategies and workforce planning.

Key Objectives:

1. Measure overall attrition by analyzing total employees, attrition count, and attrition rate.


2. Identify demographic and job-related factors contributing to employee turnover.


3. Analyze attrition trends across different employee segments (e.g., education, salary, job role, and tenure).


4. Provide visual insights using Power BI to support strategic HR decision-making.


Data Analysis & Insights:

Overall Attrition Metrics: Analyzed total employees, attrition count, and attrition rate to establish baseline trends.

Demographic Analysis: Evaluated attrition based on age group, education level, and salary slab to determine at-risk segments.

Job Role & Satisfaction Analysis: Explored attrition trends by job role, years at the company, and job satisfaction levels to identify high-risk categories.

Tenure-Based Analysis: Assessed how years of service impact attrition, identifying whether newer or long-tenured employees leave more frequently.

Salary Influence: Examined attrition rates across different salary brackets to determine the impact of compensation on turnover.


Tools & Techniques Used:

Power BI: Created interactive dashboards and visualizations to highlight key attrition trends and insights.

Excel: Performed data cleaning, transformation, and calculations to support the analysis.


Business Impact:

Helped HR teams identify high-risk employee segments for attrition, enabling proactive engagement strategies.

Provided insights into the impact of salary, job roles, and tenure on turnover, supporting data-driven HR policies.

Improved retention planning by uncovering patterns in employee exits, leading to more targeted interventions.

Enhanced HR reporting with Power BI dashboards, making insights more accessible and actionable for stakeholders.


This project demonstrates my expertise in HR analytics, data visualization with Power BI, and data-driven decision-making, turning raw HR data into meaningful business insights.
